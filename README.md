# Chainlink Fence Data Interface

An interactive, artistic visualization simulating a chainlink fence as a data container interface. This project leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a structured, calming data visualization interface representing data flow within a chainlink fence pattern.

## Features

- **Chainlink Fence Visualization**: The interface uses a dynamic, interactive chainlink fence pattern where each cell can represent active data points.
- **Data Integration**: Dummy data, such as "Access Points," "Security Checks," and "Alerts," is displayed in a data panel and linked to cells within the fence.
- **User Controls**:
  - **Cell Size**: Adjusts the size of each diamond cell in the chainlink fence pattern.
  - **Wire Thickness**: Controls the thickness of the fence wires for better visibility and aesthetic adjustments.
  - **Highlight Intensity**: Alters the intensity of highlights on active cells, allowing users to visualize active data points clearly.
- **Mobile-Friendly Design**: The interface layout is responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, with intuitive touch controls.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Use the sliders on the right to adjust the cell size, wire thickness, and highlight intensity.
3. View the simulated data on the left in the data panel. Click on any data item to activate random cells within the chainlink pattern.

## File Descriptions

- **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure for the interface, including the data panel, controls, and canvas for the chainlink fence.
- **style.css**: Defines the visual style for the chainlink fence pattern, data panel, and controls.
- **script.js**: Implements the chainlink fence visualization logic, dummy data integration, and user interactions.
- **assets/screenshots**: Contains screenshots of the interface for reference.
